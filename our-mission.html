    <h1>Our mission</h1>

    <br>

    <h2>We want to make games good again.</h2>

    <p>
        We miss the good old days, where you could just get the cartdridge and put it into your device.<br> With no ads, no micro-transactions only pure fun. <br> Nowdays we are hunted by the consumer economy even in the games we play. <br> The gaming
        business is growing day by day but we don't see the games as a business.<br> We see games as a medium of entertainment and education.<br>
        <b>So none of our games have ads or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction" target="_blank">microtransactions</a> and we don't support the current gaming business trend.</b>
        <br> Of course we also still need money to live, but we just want to have this money through donations. <br> By donating we understand that there are people who support our ideas and like our games. <br> Not because he got tricked by some shady
        psycological trick or simply because he needs to pay to play.
    </p>

    <h2>We also support Open Source Software</h2>

    <p>
        All our games are Open Source and the source code can be seen and modified. <br>
