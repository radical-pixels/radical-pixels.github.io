    <h1>Our mission</h1>

    <br>

    <h2>We want to make games good again.</h2>

    <p>
        We miss the good old days, where you could just get the cardridge and put it into your device,<br>
        With no ads, no micro-transactions and pure fun. <br>
        Nowdays we get hunt by the consumer economy even in the games we play. <br>
        The gaming business is rising and rising but we don't see the games as a buisness.<br>
        We see games as a medium of entertainment and education.<br>
        <b>So none of our games has ads or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction" target="_blank">microtransactions</a> and we don't support the current gaming business trend.</b>
        <br>
        Of course we also still need money to survive, but we just want to get that money by donations. <br>
        Because we want to know that somebody wants to give us money and wants to support us because he likes our games. <br>
        Not because he got tricked by some shady psicological trick or simply because he needs to pay to play.
    </p>

    <h2>We also support Open Source Software</h2>

    <p>
        All our games are Open Source and the source code can be seen and modified. <br>
